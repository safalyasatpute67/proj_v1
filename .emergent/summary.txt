The previous AI engineer initiated the development of the Nexus Crisis Intelligence platform based on a comprehensive product description. The core task was to quickly identify and build the maximum value feature. The engineer meticulously reviewed the provided environment setup, development workflow, and critical rules, particularly regarding URL management, environment variables, and third-party integrations.

The initial phase involved setting up the required dependencies. The engineer observed the existing environment files (, ) and then proceeded to install  and  for the frontend's interactive map and usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]

  -v, --verbose         Set verbosity.
  -b API_BASE, --api-base API_BASE
                        What API base url to use.
  -k API_KEY, --api-key API_KEY
                        What API key to use.
  -p PROXY [PROXY ...], --proxy PROXY [PROXY ...]
                        What proxy to use.
  -o ORGANIZATION, --organization ORGANIZATION
                        Which organization to run as (will use your default
                        organization if not specified)
  -t {openai,azure}, --api-type {openai,azure}
                        The backend API to call, must be `openai` or `azure`
  --api-version API_VERSION
                        The Azure API version, e.g.
                        'https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-
                        services/openai/reference#rest-api-versioning'

                        id
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit along with other packages for the backend's AI-powered features. Crucially, before attempting any integration, the engineer correctly identified the need for an OpenAI API key and paused to explicitly request it from the user, adhering to the strict rule of obtaining external API keys before proceeding with implementation. This demonstrates a strong adherence to the provided guidelines and a methodical approach to development, prioritizing critical external dependencies.

<product_requirements>
The Nexus Crisis Intelligence platform aims to be a community-centric digital ecosystem for India, providing real-time information and tools for public awareness, community resilience, and streamlined communication during various events (disruptions, public health, severe weather).

Key features include:
1.  **Multi-Source Information Hub**: Aggregates data from official alerts (NDMA, IMD, GDACS), national/regional news, and social media.
2.  **AI-Powered Information Processing**: Uses AI for automated event detection, type/severity analysis (NLP), key information extraction (NER), and automated event summaries.
3.  **Interactive India Geo-Map**: Primary interface displaying live event plotting with color-coded icons, multi-layer visualization (weather, infrastructure, community assets), and personalized location alerts via SMS/email/push.
4.  **Community Resilience Hub**: Provides hyperlocal information, resource directory, preparedness portal, and volunteer/aid coordination (powered by Resilience Agent).
5.  **Public Health Sentinel**: Offers health trend dashboards, early warning information, and a health resources map (powered by Health Agent).
6.  **Crowdsourced Civic Reporter**: Enables mobile-first issue reporting with geotagging, public transparency map, automated routing to departments, and status update notifications (powered by Civic Agent).

The immediate goal is to build the maximum value feature quickly, focusing on functionality over minor UI/UX refinements or privacy, aiming for a rapid aha moment.

The previous AI engineer has completed the initial environment setup for both the frontend and backend. Specifically, they have:
1.  Identified and confirmed the existing  variables for MongoDB in the backend and reviewed the frontend .
2.  Installed essential frontend dependencies ( and ) required for the interactive map feature. This suggests an initial focus on the Interactive India Geo-Map as a high-value feature.
3.  Installed crucial backend dependencies, including the usage: openai [-h] [-v] [-b API_BASE] [-k API_KEY] [-p PROXY [PROXY ...]]

  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit library and other related packages (e.g., , ), which are necessary for implementing the AI-Powered Information Processing features.
4.  Paused the development workflow to explicitly request the OpenAI API key from the user. This action is critical because external API keys are a prerequisite for using services like OpenAI and must be obtained before integration as per the system's strict guidelines. The development is currently blocked pending this input from the user.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Obtain the OpenAI API key from the user and then proceed with integrating the OpenAI API into the backend.
